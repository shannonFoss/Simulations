#Simulations

These programs use a Simulation Software Package called JavaDEVS, written by Dr. Todd Ebert for his Simulations classes.

The zip file containing all of the necessary classes has been stored here.

The first program is a simulation of a set of train stations and their accompanying trains.  It calculates the efficiency of the planned routes for the trains by measuring the average wait time of the passengers.

The second program is a simulation of the GRID Containment System, which is a prototypical overhead crane system designed for efficiently storing cargo.  The simulation removes containers from a train, stores them into the GRID, then removes any containers that are going to the same destiation as the train and places them on that train.  When the train is full, or there are no more containers in the GRID that need to go to that destination, then the train leaves.  The simulation was used to find an optimal number of Overhead Transfer Units for different sized GRIDs.
